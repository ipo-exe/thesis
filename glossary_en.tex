% distribution function
\newglossaryentry{downscaling2}
{
    name=distribution function,
    description={A method or function used in hydrological modeling to distribute or adjust parameters or variables from a larger scale to a smaller scale, or vice versa. This function helps transfer information between different levels of spatial detail, ensuring that local characteristics are adequately represented in the model}

% hydrological similarity
\newglossaryentry{hydro-simi}
{
    name=hydrological similarity,
    description={A condition in which different regions or hydrological units exhibit similar hydrological behavior, allowing them to be grouped or treated uniformly in hydrological models. Hydrological similarity is used to simplify distributed modeling by grouping areas with homogeneous hydrological responses}
}

% semi-distributed models
\newglossaryentry{models-semid}
{
    name=semi-distributed models,
    description={Hydrological models that use an intermediate approach between fully distributed models and aggregated models. These models divide the watershed into hydrological response units, allowing for a more detailed representation than aggregated models but with less computational complexity than distributed models}
}

% saturation index
\newglossaryentry{tsi}
{
    name=saturation index,
    description={A topographic indicator used in hydrological modeling to represent soil saturation in a given area. The saturation index relates topographic characteristics such as slope and drainage area to determine the propensity of an area to become saturated during rainfall events, and it is fundamental for the local distribution of soil water deficit in hydrological models}
}

% Topographic Wetness Index (TWI)
\newglossaryentry{twi}
{
    name=Topographic Wetness Index (\texttt{TWI}),
    description={A topographic index used to estimate soil moisture based on terrain slope and drainage area. It is calculated by the formula $\text{T}_i = \ln{(\alpha_{i}/\tan \beta_{i})}$, where $\alpha_{i}$ is the local drainage area per unit contour length, and $\beta_{i}$ is the local terrain slope. \texttt{TWI} helps identify areas prone to saturation and runoff, and is widely used in hydrological models such as \texttt{TOPMODEL}}

% hydraulic transmissivity
\newglossaryentry{trans-hyd}
{
    name=hydraulic transmissivity,
    description={A soil property that represents the capacity of the porous medium to transmit water per unit of width and depth. Equivalent to hydraulic conductivity per unit of lateral contour}
}

% digital elevation model (DEM)
\newglossaryentry{dem}
{
    name=digital elevation model (\texttt{DEM}),
    description={A digital representation of the Earth's surface that captures the topography of a specific area, used in geoprocessing and hydrological modeling to derive characteristics such as slope, drainage area, and topographic wetness indices}
}

% Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND)
\newglossaryentry{hand}
{
    name=Height Above Nearest Drainage (\texttt{HAND}),
    description={A topographic index representing the height of a point relative to the nearest drainage channel. It is calculated as the difference between the local altitude and the altitude of the nearest drainage point. \texttt{HAND} is used to map wetlands and identify flood risks, making it a valuable tool for hydrological modeling and geoprocessing by representing the topography in relation to drainage networks}
}

% separating surface
\newglossaryentry{sepsurf}
{
    name=separating surface,
    description={A surface created by the vertical permeability transition between soil horizons, separating vertical flow into a lateral component. The concept is generalized by the theory of connectivity}

% activation threshold
\newglossaryentry{activ-threshold}
{
    name=activation threshold,
    description={The minimum level required for the connectivity of a reservoir's drainage network (channels or pores) to begin transmitting water}
}

% Connectivity Theory
\newglossaryentry{conect-theory}
{
    name=Connectivity Theory,
    description={A unifying theory of Hydrology proposed by Jeffrey McDonnell and colleagues to overcome the problems of the differentiation paradigm and address the old water paradox}

\newglossaryentry{func-activ}
{
    name=activation function,
    description={A formal hypothesis about how the activation of a reservoir develops as saturation occurs}
}

% fragmentation level
\newglossaryentry{frag-level}
{
    name=fragmentation level,
    description={A parameter that regulates the speed of activation in the saturation equation. The higher the fragmentation, the more dampened the reservoir's activation becomes. The value of the fragmentation level corresponds to the reservoir value at half the maximum activation speed}
